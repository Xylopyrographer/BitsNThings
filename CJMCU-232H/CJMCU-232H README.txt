The ubiquitous CJMCU-232H board.

Contains the original schematic and revised versions corrected the match the boards most frequently found.

This board is based on the FTDI reference design as found in section 6.1 "USB Bus Powered Configuration" of the "FT232H SINGLE CHANNEL HI-SPEED USB TO MULTIPURPOSE UART/FIFO IC" data sheet (version 1.82).

It was a real bear hunting down the schematic. A. Real. Bear!
